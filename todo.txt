- landing page
    - tutorial. images, also explain what access token is. also reassure user that no issues will arise
    - enter access token then enter.
        - once entered, fetch the data. if it didn't work invalidate the access token gracefully.
        - show dashboard. show filters (make it best UX practices though)
- also have a page for limitations
    - sorry cant login with canvas, i need dev account. need to ask professors. if this is good, then i will raise this so i can implement it :)
    - local storage only. not persistent.

- show github OSS project login
- send recommendations email link.
- in landing page make sure marketing is good. but has to be open source, secure (local) and free.
- dashboard view. default on upcoming. can have all. can filter to unsubmitted/late.
- have option to see it by course.
- have timestamp of when data was fetched. can fetch data again manually.
